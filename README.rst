  Set up Terminal and Shell
#############################

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Introduction
============

Documents my personal setup.

At a later point I will use GNU Stow to manage configuration.

Install prefered shell - zsh
----------------------------

For macOS and Linux I will for now use zsh - but I am considering nushell (which also run on Windows!)

| For Windows I will for now use the built-in shells.
| I will later go into how to configure WSL.

Install prefered terminal emulator - Ghostty
--------------------------------------------

| I will use GhostTTY on my Linux (debian and fedora) and macOS.
| For Windows 11 I will use the regular Windows Terminal.

Install prefered Terminal theme - Oh-My-Posh
--------------------------------------------

I will use Oh-My-Posh, as it is universal across my shells.
